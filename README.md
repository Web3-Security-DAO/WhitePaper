Web3 Security DAO (W3SD) WhitePaper

>  Protecting Web3 and Crypto Security Together.



## 1. Introduction

### The Growth and Challenges of Web3

The Web3 ecosystem is advancing rapidly, driving innovations in decentralized finance (DeFi), NFTs, the metaverse, and more. However, alongside these breakthroughs, the sector faces escalating security challenges. Fraud, phishing, and money laundering are increasingly pervasive, endangering user assets and ecosystem stability.

In 2024 alone, the cryptocurrency industry reported losses in the billions due to hacking and fraud. These security issues not only undermine user trust but also pose major barriers to mainstream cryptocurrency adoption. High-profile cryptocurrency thefts have further eroded investor confidence.

Tether reported in 2024, freezing more than 1,000 high-risk addresses, involving funds exceeding $1 billion. Similarly, Ethereum and Tron have collaborated with regulators, leveraging smart contracts to block hundreds of addresses associated with money laundering and scams.

Despite these efforts, they barely scratch the surface. Thousands of high-risk addresses remain unidentified. hidden within the blockchain’s vast expanse. These unidentified addresses—potentially linked to phishing websites, fraudulent investment platforms, and even transnational criminal activities—represent severe threats to the trust and stability of Web3 ecosystem.



## 2. The Origin of USDT BlackList

The **[USDT BlackList](https://www.usdtblacklist.com/)** project, launched in April 2023, offers a free service for checking the risk levels of cryptocurrency addresses. The platform enable Web3 users identify and avoid on-chain risks. By integrating multi-dimensional data sources, it has developed an intelligent risk analysis system that brings transparency to potential on-chain threats and delivers precise risk warnings. To date, the platform has successfully helped users avoid tens of thousands of high-risk addresses.

#### The main data sources for USDT BlackList include

- **Partner Data: **Risk data provided by blockchain security alliances and third-party service providers.
- **Intelligent Analysis System: **Automatic analysis of on-chain transactions and associated activities to identify malicious addresses involved in fraud, phishing, or sanctioned activities.
- **Public News and Reports: **Aggregation and analysis of publicly available reports on Web3 security incidents via a web crawler system.
- **User Feedback: **Collection of user-submitted risk clues, which are validated through community collaboration.

## 3. Advancing Decentralization

### Protecting Web3 and Crypto Security Together.

After over a year of centralized operations, we realized that relying exclusively on our team is insufficient to comprehensively address the governance of on-chain risks. To involve more individuals in safeguarding Web3 security and to achieve transparent and equitable risk management, we decided to transition to a decentralized governance model via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

![DAO](https://w3sd.org/WhitePaper/img/DAO.png)

Through the Web3 Security DAO (W3SD), our goal is to establish a global Web3 security community where individuals, companies, and organizations can become part of the governance structure. Together, we will develop and maintain the world's most reliable Web3 risk data source, empowering every user to contribute to the security of the Web3 ecosystem.



### 3.1 Governance

#### Benefits of DAO Governance

- **Democratized Decision-Making: **All DAO members can propose and vote, enabling collective wisdom to drive decisions.
- **Transparency and Credibility: **Governance records are stored on-chain, making processes traceable and tamper-proof.
- **Efficiency and Automation: **Smart contracts automatically execute voting outcomes, reducing manual intervention and delays.
- **Inclusivity: **Anyone meeting minimum requirements can join as a DAO member and participate in governance.
- **Incentive Mechanism: **Token-based rewards encourage greater participation, boosting community activity and data quality.



#### Principles of DAO Governance

- **On-Chain Proposals: **DAO members can submit proposals, such as marking an address as high-risk.
- **Voting Mechanism: **Once a proposal is submitted, eligible DAO members vote to support or oppose it.
- **Smart Contract Execution: **After voting concludes, smart contracts execute the decision, updating risk records and distributing rewards accordingly.

![how-web3-voting-works](https://w3sd.org/WhitePaper/img/how-web3-voting-works.png)

By embracing DAO governance, the community shifts from passive recipients of centralized services to active creators and managers of risk data.



### 3.2 Web3 Voting

#### Advantages of Web3 Voting

- **Enhanced Security: **Cryptographic techniques and consensus mechanisms protect the integrity of voting results.
- **Transparency: **All proposals, votes, and results are publicly accessible, eliminating opaque operations.
- **High Efficiency: **Smart contracts automate execution, reducing costs and time.
- **Real-Time Updates: **Proposals and voting outcomes can be updated in realtime, accelerating decision-making.
- **Fairness: **Token holdings and participation balance voting power, ensuring democratic governance.
- **Global Accessibility: **On-chain voting removes geographic barriers, fostering worldwide participation and collaboration.

Through decentralized governance and incentive models, W3SD unites Web3 users globally to build a secure, transparent, and trustworthy on-chain ecosystem.



#### Incentive Rules

- If a proposal passes, both the proposer and supportive voters receive rewards.
- If a proposal fails, only supportive voters are rewarded, discouraging frivolous proposals.



### 3.3 Token

#### Roles of Governance Tokens

- **Voting Weight: **Each token represents one vote. Members holding more tokens have greater influence, aligning rights with responsibilities.
- **Incentive Mechanism: **Tokens serve as rewards to encourage active participation in proposals, voting, and data submission.
- **Economic Sustainability: **Token distribution and consumption (e.g., governance fees) ensure the long-term viability of the community.
- **Access Control: **Holding tokens is a prerequisite for governance participation, fostering a community of engaged and contributing members.

![governance-token](https://w3sd.org/WhitePaper/img/governance-token.png)

#### Advantages of Governance Tokens

- **Fairness: **Token holdings determine voting weight, preventing governance monopolization.
- **Value Creation: **Token circulation and appreciation are directly tied to community growth.
- **Resource Allocation: **Token-based rewards attract developers, data contributors, and security researchers.



## 4. Built on Polkadot

As blockchain technology continues to evolve, both Layer 1 and Layer 0 networks are rapidly expanding, each serving distinct purposes within the ecosystem. From the vast cosmos of blockchain ecosystems, Polkadot stands out with a clear vision:

![built-on-polkadot](https://w3sd.org/WhitePaper/img/built-on-polkadot.svg)

> ##### *"We envision a Web where our identity and our data is our own - safely secured from any central authority."*
>
> — Polkadot network

Expanding on the above, Polkadot’s founder aims to establish the multi-chain web of the future.

> ##### *"My goal isn’t to build a multi-chain universe. Interoperability is a means of reaching a goal but isn’t the goal itself. My goal is to create Web3, a third generation Internet platform allowing for barrier-less trading and service provisions throughout the realm of human endeavor."*
>
> — Dr. Gavin Wood, Founder of Polkadot
